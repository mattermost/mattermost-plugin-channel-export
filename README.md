This plugin allows channel export into a human readable format.

## License

This repository is licensed under the [Mattermost Source Available License](LICENSE) and requires a valid Enterprise E20 license. See [Mattermost Source Available License](https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/faq.html#mattermost-source-available-license) to learn more.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to a directory outside of `$GOPATH`
```
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-export.git
```

Note that this project uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). Be sure to locate the project outside of `$GOPATH`, or allow the use of Go modules within your `$GOPATH` with an `export GO111MODULE=on`.

Build the plugin:
```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.mattermost.plugin-channel-export.tar.gz
```

There is a build target to automate deploying and enabling the plugin to your server, but it requires login credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or configuration of a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

Alternatively, if you are running your `mattermost-server` out of a sibling directory by the same name, use the `deploy` target alone to  unpack the files into the right directory. You will need to restart your server and manually enable your plugin.

In production, deploy and upload your plugin via the [System Console](https://about.mattermost.com/default-plugin-uploads).
